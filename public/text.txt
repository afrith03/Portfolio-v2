Why do you think the nominee should be inducted into the ServiceNow MVP program?
(Tell them to copy the below answer)

Suggested Answer (strong + natural):

Afrith Shariff is one of the most passionate and consistent contributors I’ve seen in the ServiceNow ecosystem. He shares practical solutions, developer tips, and deep-dive explanations across ITSM, CSM, SecOps, Integrations, Virtual Agent, Now Assist, and Agentic AI.

He actively mentors others, simplifies complex topics, and openly shares reusable approaches like catalog development patterns, end-to-end integration methods, and real-world architectural guidance.

Afrith always helps the community with sincerity and clarity—whether it’s GlideRecordSecure usage, workflow best practices, SecOps configurations, or AI-driven automations. His impact has helped many professionals grow and solve real business problems.

I strongly believe he deserves to be part of the ServiceNow MVP program.
